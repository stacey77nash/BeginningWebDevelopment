        <h2>Beginnings</h2>

        <!--The p tags or elements are for paragraph sentences-->

        <p>On Thanksgiving Day in 1970, I was born into a world that would see unprecedented changes in the following five decades of my life. I was a black female born into a lower socioeconomic class, blessed with intelligent, loving, hard-working parents who sacrificed so much to give their children more opportunities than they ever had.</p>

        <!-- second h2 header -->
        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>As a result of my parent's generous support, I was able to participate as a trombonist in the Jefferson Junior High Band. By 9th grade, I was one of seven Cooper High School band students that were selected by audition to participate in the Texas All State Band. I was very fortunate to be in the Cooper Band at that time (1985-88). We had 427 members, and during those years, Cooper was the largest high school band in the nation. But it wasn't only the size that made it unique. The band excelled, and went to state-level contests every year, usually placing the top 5. The band directors had laid a strong foundation for students who wanted to pursue a career in music. </p>

        <p>I completed a Bachelor's degree in Music Education in 1997. Teaching school taught me so much, and I met a lot of wonderful students, parents, faculty, and staff. But I still had dreams of being a professional musician, and they weren't going away. In 2009, at the age of 38, and after twelve years of teaching in public schools, I returned to college to complete a Master's degree in Jazz Studies, string bass concentration, at the University of Louisville in Kentucky.</p>

        <!-- third h2 header -->
        <h2>Cruising</h2>

        <p>After completing my graduate degree in 2011, I auditioned for a job as a cruise line musician. Five months later - five days before my 40th birthday - I boarded a cruise ship for the first time in my life in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. I worked as a professional bassist and musical drector for cruise lines for almost eight years. In that chapter of my life, I was able to see many different countries, meet fascinating people from around the world, and make lifelong friends.</p>

        <p>Although it was a very interesting and rewarding career, and had many of the elements of a dream job, it became harder to return to the ships with each contract. I knew that I needed to return home. I wanted to cultivate healthy relationships with my family, while they were still alive. In 2019, I returned to Abilene. </p>

        <!-- fourth h2 header -->
        <h2>Grateful</h2>

        <p>Living in Abilene continues to be a rewarding journey. It has been challenging, but I am thankful that our family has grown closer together. I am thankful that I had a chance to spend time with my brother, uncle, and grandma before they went to be with the Lord in 2020. I am exceedingly grateful to be enrolled at TSTC studying computer programming, which is a subject that I have admired from a distance since the age of nine. And I have enjoyed forming authentic, meaningful relationships with family and friends. It's amazing to spend time with friends that I have known since the 80's. </p>

        <p>I don't mind being a late bloomer. It has helped me to truly appreciate life in all of its beauty and complexity. </p>
