            <dt><b>The Jeffersons</b></dt>
            <dd>
                <i>The Jeffersons</i>, created by legendary TV writer and producer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norman_Lear" target="_blank">Norman Lear</a>, aired for eleven seasons from January 1975 to July 1985. The show centered around George and Louise Jefferson, an affluent black couple in New York and owners of a successful dry-cleaning franchise. The sitcom tackled complicated issues, such as illiteracy, racism, and alcoholism while maintaining a balance of comedy and satire. One of my favorite parts of the show was the <a href="https://youtu.be/_-OnRQ4P0VY" target="_blank">theme song</a>.

            <dt><b>The Twilight Zone</b></dt>

The series covered an eclectic mix of genres, including science fiction, westerns, horror, psychological thriller, fantasy, and dark comedy. Most of the episodes had a surprise outcome, and the ending monologue usually summed up the moral of the story. In 2013, <i>TV Guide</i> ranked the series as #5 in the list of the 60 all-time greatest TV shows. The <i>Twilight Zone</i> is filmed entirely in black and white, and the show's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b5aW08ivHU" target="_blank">theme music</a> is instantly recognizable.

Kelley</a>, creator of <i>Big Little Lies</i> and <i>The Practice</i>. Two investigators are searching for three teenage girls who have been kidnapped, and find that one of the kidnappers works in law enforcement.
